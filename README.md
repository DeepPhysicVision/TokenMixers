### Introduction
This repository includes the official Pytorch implementation for the following works on the basic neural operaters for mixing tokens, i.e., token mixers:
- [Active Token Mixer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06108), AAAI 2023 Oral, in [this folder](./Active%20Token%20Mixer/).
- [Adaptive Frequency Filters As Efficient Global Token Mixers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14008), ICCV 2023, in [this folder](./Adaptive%20Frequency%20Filters/).
